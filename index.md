On the 17th of November, ArenaNet - the developer of a MMO game Guild Wars 2 - changed their payment provider for in-game purchases. Whether the change was for the better or worse is to be discussed, yet, I wanted to buy some *gems* (premium currency) to spend on cool items in the store. Having tried my usual payment method that ended up being broken for some reason, I started exploring the new UI.

One of the options hidden under "Other" is Paysafecard. In this scheme, one buys a payment code and then, during checkout, is redirected to the Paysafecard website to enter it. The game makes it possible to finish this flow in a single window because it's using an embedded browser to display this whole UI.

This is where I noticed **my account now had an extra 1600 gems**. But I didn't make any transaction?!

Digging deeper, after retracing my steps I realized backing out of the Paysafecard UI, *without paying*, added the gems to my account, **again**. I now had 3200 gems.

This clearly had to just be a visual bug, right? The balance has updated, but it didn't actually make any transaction. Or so I was thinking, **until the emails arrived.**

At this point I was facing a pretty serious vulnerability where anyone could get **endless amount of free gems**, only limited by how fast they could click through the UI. So I did the responsible thing and went to report it.

Getting ahold of a live human at ArenaNet has proven difficult. My first thought to try `exploits@arena.net` only led me to realize [it has been disabled](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/hiv04q/psa_exploitsarenanet_has_been_disabled/). I submitted a support ticket instead (as advised in the post) and, with a healthy dose of skepticism, waited.

About 30 minutes after my report, the payment UI went down briefly. I didn't try the exploit for obvious reasons, althouhg I was tempted to check if perhaps *someone* has just hot-patched this.

How many players exactly have taken advantage of this bug? Only ArenaNet knows. **The root cause? Not given**, but I expect a developer left themselves a nice and convenient "acceeept payment by closing the window" test feature that *somehow* got into the live build.

What I know is that they let me keep half of the free gems, worth $20, so I guess I can put that towards my lifetime bug bounty stat. Progress!

But hey, at least I ~~got chicken~~ won't be getting banned, so that's a plus?
